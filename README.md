# ASCII Wordart
## Slash Command for MixMax

Allows users to insert ASCII wordart into their emails using the [MixMax Chrome extension](https://mixmax.com/).
Depending how it is setup in your MixMax dashboard, the command will look something like `/wordart [text]` (e.g., `/wordart Hello world!`).  Users can select which font they like from the suggestion menu, which will populate as the user types.
